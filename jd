Person should have good understanding of DevOps/DevSecOps principles & practices


"Hello, my name is Anand Patil, and I am thrilled to be here today. I bring over 15 years of experience in the IT industry, specializing in DevOps practices and Application Deployment. Throughout my career, I have developed expertise in various technologies and methodologies to ensure efficient and seamless software delivery.

I have spent more than 6 years working on Application Deployment using Jenkins and Maven. My proficiency lies in orchestrating and automating deployment processes, ensuring reliability and consistency across different environments. I take pride in leveraging tools like Docker and Kubernetes to containerize applications and manage scalable, resilient, and efficient deployments in cloud-native environments.

One of my key strengths is my hands-on experience with Docker and Kubernetes, where I have successfully implemented containerization strategies and managed Kubernetes clusters to deploy both stateless and stateful applications. I believe in staying at the forefront of technology, and my proficiency in these areas aligns with the must-have requirements mentioned in the job description.

Additionally, I have a good understanding of Release Management practices, which I consider a valuable asset in ensuring the successful delivery of software products. I thrive in implementing DevOps and DevSecOps principles, promoting collaboration between development and operations teams to achieve continuous integration, delivery, and security.

I am eager to bring my wealth of experience and passion for DevOps to contribute to the success of your team. I look forward to discussing how my skills align with your organization's goals and how I can bring value to the team."





Stateless means each instance is independent and doesn't "remember" anything about previous instances. It's like disposable lunch boxes.

Stateful means each instance has a unique identity and "remembers" its previous state. It's like reusable lunch boxes with name tags.
