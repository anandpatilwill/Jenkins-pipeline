My proficiency lies in orchestrating and automating deployment processes, ensuring reliability and consistency across different environments. I take pride in leveraging tools like Docker and Kubernetes to containerize applications and manage scalable, resilient, and efficient deployments in cloud-native environments.

One of my key strengths is my hands-on experience with Docker and Kubernetes, where I have successfully implemented containerization strategies and managed Kubernetes clusters to deploy both stateless and stateful applications.

Stateless means each instance is independent and doesn't "remember" anything about previous instances. It's like disposable lunch boxes.

Stateful means each instance has a unique identity and "remembers" its previous state. It's like reusable lunch boxes with name tags.
